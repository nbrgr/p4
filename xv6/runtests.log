test build PASSED
 (build xv6 using make)

test clone PASSED (9 of 9)
 (clone and verify that address space is shared)

test badclone PASSED (6 of 6)
 (clone with bad stack argument)

test join4 PASSED (3 of 3)
 (join, not wait, should handle threads)

test thread2 PASSED (7 of 7)
 (memory leaks from thread library?)

test join3 PASSED (3 of 3)
 (join should not handle child processes (forked))

test join2 PASSED (6 of 6)
 (join argument checking)

test clone3 PASSED (3 of 3)
 (clone copies file descriptors, but doesn't share)

test clone2 PASSED (6 of 6)
 (clone and play with the argument)

test stack PASSED (8 of 8)
 (set up stack correctly (and without extra items))

test size PASSED (7 of 7)
 (check that address space size is updated in threads)

test multi PASSED (8 of 8)
 (multiple threads with some depth of function calls)

test noexit PASSED (7 of 7)
 (no exit call in thread, should trap at bogus address)

test join PASSED (9 of 9)
 (clone and join syscalls)

test thread PASSED (10 of 10)
 (thread user library functions)

test locks PASSED (8 of 8)
 (test lock correctness)
